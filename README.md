## Backend

### Setup:

1. Install the tools:

- `sequelize`
- `sequelize-cli`
- `pg` (driver so sequelize knows how to talk to postgres)

2. Init sequelize: `npx sequelize-cli init`

3. Modify config.json (to point to our new database).

4. Modify models/index.js (later).

## Creating a model

Command:
`npx sequelize-cli model:generate --name user --attributes name:string,email:string,password:string`

## Running the migrations so the tables get created:

Run migrations: `npx sequelize-cli db:migrate`
Undo migrations: `npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo:all`

## Seed files

Create a seed file: `npx sequelize-cli seed:generate --name some-users`
Run seed files `npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all`

# REST - REpresentational State Transfer

- 3 main principles:

* Operations as HTTP methods
* Respond with appropriate HTTP status codes
* Use clean and meaningful URLs (endpoints).

### Http methods:

GET, DELETE, POST, PUT, PATCH  
Read, delete, Create, update, update

PATCH => { email: 'sdasd' }, PUT => { name: 'matias', email: 'sasds', ... }

### Http status codes:

200... All went good => All good
300... Redirect => no longer here
400... Client/user error => you screwed up.
500... Server Error => I screwed up.

200 - OK

400 - Bad request
401 - Unauthorized
403 - Forbidden
404 - Not found

500 - Internal server error

### Clean and meaningful urls:

GET - /getUsers
GET - /getLists
GET - /getUsersAndLists
GET - /listById/:id
POST - /createAUser

GET - /users
POST - /users
GET - /users/:id
PATCH - /user/:id

## Sending data on the request.

GET + DELETE => We can't send any data with these requests.
=> We can send url params (`/user/:id`).

Body of the request => payload.

POST - `/users` = body => { name: 'wouter', email: 'Ã¡sdasdasd', ..., }
